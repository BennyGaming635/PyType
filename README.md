# PyType
***
## Whats PyType?
Like to train your WPM and type better? Like using tools like typing.com but don't like the ads? PyType solves those issues by having a private and secure typing trainer.

## How to install?
Just have **Python** installed and these libraries;

**- Time**
**- Random**
**- DateTime**
**- OS**

You can install these by running *pip install time random datetime os* in PowerShell on Windows.

## Will you support other OSs like MacOS and Linux?
Most likely not. If they work then good luck though!
